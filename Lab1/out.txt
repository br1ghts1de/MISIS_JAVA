MY SOVIET PASSPORT 
 
I'd rip out 
                bureaucracy's guts, 
                                              I would. 
No reverence for mandates- 
                                             good riddance! 
Pack off to very hell 
                               for good 
any old paper, 
                      but this one... 
Past berths and compartments 
                                                drawn out in a line 
moves a customs official, 
                                       most courteous Iooking. 
Folks hand in their passports 
                                              and I hand in mine, 
my crimson-jacketed 
                                  bookling. 
Some passports 
                         bring smiles 
                                             in a matter of instants. 
Others  
          are fit but to fie on.  
Special deference 
                            is shown, 
                                          for instance 
for those  
              with the double-bed 
                                               British Leo. 
Bowing non-stop, 
                            as if rocked by a ship,  
eating their eyes 
                           into the "kind old uncles",  
they take, 
               as if they were taking a tip  
the passports 
                     of lanky Yankees.  
At Polish passports 
                              they bulge out their eyes 
in thick-skulled 
                         policemen's 
                                           donkeyness, 
as if to say: 
                  what 
                         the devil are these  
geographical 
                     novelties? 
Without even turning 
                                 their cabbage-like heads, 
hardly deigning 
                          to touch them,  
they take, 
               absent-minded, 
                                        the passports of Swedes 
and all sorts 
                    of other Dutchmen.  
But suddenly 
                    Mr. Officer's face 
                                               turns awry, 
as if 
       he has smelled disaster.  
You've guessed it: 
                             the officer's taken my  
red-skinned hulk of a passport.  
He handles it 
                     like a hedgehog 
                                              or bomb, 
like a bee 
                to be nipped 
                                     by the wings, 
like a twisting rattlesnake 
                                         three yards long 
with a hundred 
                        deadly stings. 
The porter winks; 
                            to tell the truth,  
he'd carry your luggage 
                                     free 
                                           all the way for you. 
The gendarme 
                       looks questioningly 
                                                     at the sleuth,  
the sleuth looks back: 
                                  what to do with this wayfarer? 
With what delight, 
                           by the gendarmes, 
                                                       damn it, 
I'd be flayed, 
                   crucified, 
                                hanged 
for the crime of holding 
                                      a sickled, 
                                                     hammered 
Soviet passport 
                        in my hand! 
I'd rip out bureaucracy's guts, 
                                              I would. 
No reverence for mandates - 
                                               good riddance! 
Pack off to very hell 
                               for good 
any old paper, 
                      but this one... 
As 
    the most valuable 
                                of certificates 
I pull it 
            from the pants 
                                   where my documents are: 
read it 
          envy me - 
                           I'm a citizen 
of the USSR!
